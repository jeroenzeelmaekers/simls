## How it works

simls makes use of the cli tools of Xcode for the iOS simulators and Android studio for the android emulators.

### iOS Simulators

For iOS simulators makes use of the `xcrun simctl` cli that comes with Xcode. This exposes a series of commands that we use to manage the simulators.

### Android Emulators

For android emulators we use the `emulator` cli that gets shipped with Android Studio.

## Installation

simls is currently only available through Cargo and Homebrew.

### Cargo

```shell
cargo install simls
```

### Homebrew

```shell
brew tap jeroenzeelmaekers/tap
brew install simls
```
